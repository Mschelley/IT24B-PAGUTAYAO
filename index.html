            SZA News: “Snooze” Singer Picks Up Three 2024 Grammys
            SZA entered the 2024 Grammy Awards as the most nominated artist, and left as one of the night’s biggest winners with three trophies.
            
            The 33-year-old performed during Sunday’s ceremony, then collected her trophy for Best R&B Song for “Snooze” shortly after. Earlier in the day, SZA also won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Ghost In The Machine,” her collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers, and Best Progressive R&B Album for SOS prior to the televised portion of the Grammys.
            
            The R&B artist, whose real name is Solána Rowe, was obviously overwhelmed during her acceptance speech. “I came really, really far, and I can’t believe this is happening, and it feels really fake and—hi, Taylor,” she said, cutting herself off when she spotted Taylor Swift. “I’m just really grateful.”</p>
